Your task is to clone this repository and use the data to:
1. Create a simple web app which allows the user to explore the data and gain valuable insights.  
2. In a separate file, include a link to your app. Additionally, describe your thought process and justify the decisions you made regarding the tool you developed (i.e., what libraries or packages did you use and why? How did you host it and how might you host it differently in a production setting?).

Once you have done that you will submit by pushing all relevant files to the repository. 

**Note that this is a private repository. We ask that you consider this data confidential and do not make it or your code publicly available at this time or in the future.**
